 * <p> Title: Model Class - establishes the required GUI data and the computations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p> Description: This Model class is a major component of a Model View Controller (MVC)
 * application design that provides the user with a Graphical User Interface using JavaFX
 * widgets as opposed to a command line interface.
 * 
 * In this case the Model deals with an input from the user and checks to see if it conforms to
 * the requirements specified by a graphical representation of a finite state machine.
 * 
 * This is a purely static component of the MVC implementation.  There is no need to instantiate
 * the class.
